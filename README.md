<h2>Verdana</h2>

<p>A simple page meant to give a quick history and background to the typeface Verdana. The
page is tailored to showcase the typefaces style and weights, its usage and a small section
that talks about the designer. There is also a section called try me that acts as a test for 
a user to test the typeface and its style and wights with any phrase they choose.</P>
